I am a fourth year PhD student of computer science at [Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/), Tsinghua University supervised by [Yi Wu](https://jxwuyi.weebly.com/). My research interests include deep reinforcement learning and robotics. 

I love music, sci-fi and traveling in my free time. I am good at playing [古筝*GuZheng*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guzheng), a traditional Chinese musical instrument.
